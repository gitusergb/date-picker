# Date Picker

 ### Link : 
## Problem Statement
You are tasked with creating a reusable date picker UI component in React that can be easily exported and used across different applications. The date picker component should allow users to select dates from a calendar interface and provide callbacks to handle selected date changes. It should be customizable, accessible, and compatible with various screen sizes and browsers.
Technical Constraints:
Technology Stack: Implement the date picker component using React.js. 
Accessibility: Ensure the date picker component follows accessibility best practices, making it usable for all users, including those who rely on assistive technologies.
Customizability: Design the date picker component with customizable options such as date format, initial selected date, minimum and maximum selectable dates, and styling.
Responsiveness: Make the date picker component responsive to different screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience across devices.
Functional Requirements:
Date Selection:
Display a calendar interface allowing users to navigate between months and select dates.
Highlight the currently selected date.
Provide options to navigate between months and years.
Customization:
Allow customization of date format (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY).
Support setting the initial selected date and restricting selectable dates within a range (minimum and maximum dates).
Enable customization of styling to match different application themes.
Reusability:
Package the date picker component as a reusable React component that can be easily imported and used in different projects.
Document the usage and customization options for developers who utilize the component.
Example Usage
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import DatePicker from 'your-datepicker-component';

function App() {
  const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState(new Date());

  const handleDateChange = (date) => {
    setSelectedDate(date);
    // Perform any additional actions on date change
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Select a Date</h1>
      <DatePicker
        selectedDate={selectedDate}
        onDateChange={handleDateChange}
        dateFormat="MM/DD/YYYY"
        minDate={new Date()}
        maxDate={new Date(new Date().getFullYear() + 1, 11, 31)}
        // Additional customization props
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;



<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
